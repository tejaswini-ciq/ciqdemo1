  </h1>
  <p>
    This example project provides the example Excel based specification of a graphical user interface in <i>Shopping Application UI.xls</i> in the example project folder. The importer speeds up and can even enable creation of models for test generation without the need to draw structure diagrams by creating screens, forms, button and hyperlinks based on the GUI specification provided in Excel. For more information about Excel based GUI specification or using this importer please see in the Conformiq Manual section <i>Creating Models with Conformiq Creator > Using Conformiq Creator > Importing Graphical User Interfaces from Excel</i>.

    To import the sample Excel file right click on the example project in the <i>Project Explorer</i> view and select <i>Import ... > Import Graphical User Interface from Excel</i>, select the <i>Shopping Application UI.xls</i> file from the Creator project folder and click the <i>Finish</i> button. Expand and inspect the structure diagram generated into the <i>model</i> folder in the <i>Project Explorer</i> view and browse the created interface objects. Right click on the canvas and select <i>Arrange Diagram</i> to improve the layout. Use quick fixes offered in the <i>Problems view</i> to add layout information to the diagrams.
